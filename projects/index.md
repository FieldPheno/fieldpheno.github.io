The vast availability of genomic data over the last decade has created a new bottleneck for plant breeding programs. Rapidly collecting, analyzing, and utilizing phenotypic and phenomic data within a single breeding season is paramount to crop improvement. The Rife Lab focuses on developing efficient tools, technologies, and methods to optimize the plant breeding and genetics research.
