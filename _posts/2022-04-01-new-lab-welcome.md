# Welcome

On June 1, 2022, I will be starting as an Assistant Professor of Phenomics and Crop Improvement at Clemson University. I'm very excited for this transition from my current role at Kansas State and look forward to bringing many of my current projects with me (we have a bunch of updates for all of the PhenoApps!).

While I have many new projects I'm thrilled to get started on, I'm also searching for new collaborators. Please reach out if you have specific phenomics or phenotyping needs.
